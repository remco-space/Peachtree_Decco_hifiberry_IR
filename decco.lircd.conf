# LIRC configuration file for Peachtree Decco
# - march 2025 remco.space

# on raspbian (and debian & ubuntu?) this file needs to be placed in:
# /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d

# The start of this LIRC file was found here: 
# https://partofthething.com/thoughts/a-lirc-config-file-for-the-peachtree-audio-decco-ir-remote-control/
# After soldering some bodge wires to fix my own remote, i managed to rescan the 
# remote to add the "repeat" keyword. Now the volume up control doesn't stutter the motordrive. 
# This makes for a much smoother volume control.
